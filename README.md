# Nexu Backend 
This backend is building with MongoDB, Express Js/Node Js.

# Enviroment Setup

Node Js version 16.20.2
NPM version 8.19.4
```

## Install Dependencies
After run the backend you will need to install dependencies using the command
`npm i`

## Important
The `id` of the routes will be a `_id` Object of MongoDB. The id element of the JSON is also avalaible but all the querys was building using this native id of MongoDB.
The `id` value of the model.json was savit because i don't know if has some else purpose

## Notes
The structure of the project is a little different than what we usually do due to the use of tests, which broke my usual scheme a little.
I noticed that the project does not require pagination of the data, so I did not apply it. But in a real proyect this slows down frontend performance.
I laid the foundations for the pagination that I usually use in the models.
